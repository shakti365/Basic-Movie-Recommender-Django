# Basic-Movie-Recommender-Django

A basic movie recommendation web-app is created using Django framework. The app uses ImDB Dataset for movie and user information. Recommendations are given on Item-Item based Similarity measure calculated using the user ratings for a movie and its other details. This is a pet project made just to get a hands-on idea about Python's Django framework and Basic Recommendation system.
